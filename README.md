# Test-retest_of_aperiodic_components
This repository  realizes the extraction of aperiodic components and the computation of the test-retest reliability.
All code and plots in paper has been uploaded and written in python and R.
Preprocessing of EEG data, calculation of aperiodic parameters as well as ICC values can be found at the analysis in the group_analysis directory.
