This repository provides the complete code implementation and visualization pipeline for the paper:

**Li, N., Yang, J., Long, C., & Lei, X. (2024). Test-Retest Reliability of EEG Aperiodic Components in Resting and Mental Task States. *Brain Topography*, 37(6), 961‚Äì971.**

## Overview

This repository contains:
- Complete Python implementation of the analysis pipeline
- Code for all figures and visualizations in the paper
- Preprocessing scripts for scalp EEG data
- Aperiodic activity extraction methods (FOOOF and LMER)
- Test-retest reliability (ICC) calculation procedures

**Note:** The original raw EEG data is **NOT** included in this repository.

## About the Study

This study systematically investigates the test-retest reliability of EEG aperiodic components across different data durations, experimental states (resting and mental tasks), and extraction methods (FOOOF and LMER) at both short (90-min) and long (one-month) intervals.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

## Analysis Pipeline

The analysis workflow consists of the following steps:

### 1. Preprocessing
- filtering
- Downsampling
- Channel interpolation
- Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for artifact removal
- Average reference

### 2. Power Spectral Density (PSD) Estimation
- Welch's method
- Frequency range: 1-40 Hz

### 3. Aperiodic Component Extraction
Two methods are implemented:

#### FOOOF Method
- Separates periodic and aperiodic components
- Extracts exponent and offset parameters

#### LMER Method
- Fits linear regression to log-log PSD
- Estimates slope (exponent) and intercept (offset)

### 4. Reliability Analysis
- Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) calculation
- ICC(2,k) model for random effects
